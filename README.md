# AI Text Detector

The AI Text Detector is a comprehensive system that uses machine learning to identify AI-generated content in text and documents. It consists of a FastAPI backend service that analyzes text using a state-of-the-art deep learning model, and a Telegram bot interface that makes this technology accessible to users.

## Features

- **Advanced AI Detection**: Uses a transformer-based neural network model to determine the probability of text being AI-generated
- **Document Analysis**: Supports DOCX document uploads for analysis
- **Paragraph-level Detection**: Analyzes text at the paragraph level to provide detailed insights
- **Telegram Bot Interface**: Easy-to-use Telegram bot for submitting text or documents
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides comprehensive analysis reports with probability scores for each paragraph
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes CUDA for faster processing when available

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, PyTorch, Transformers
- **Frontend**: Telegram Bot API (aiogram)
- **Analysis**: Document processing with python-docx, pandas for data handling
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **AI Model**: DeBERTa-based classifier for detecting AI-generated text

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-text-detector.git
   cd ai-text-detector
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Telegram bot token:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
   ```

3. Build and start the project:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage

Once running, users can interact with the bot on Telegram to analyze text or documents:

1. **Start the bot**: Send `/start` to begin
2. **Analyze text**: Use the `/text` command and follow with the text you want to analyze
3. **Analyze documents**: Send a DOCX file directly to the bot
4. **Check status**: Use `/status` to verify the service is operational
5. **Get help**: Send `/help` for usage instructions

The bot will process the text or document and return:
- A summary of AI detection probabilities across all paragraphs
- A detailed breakdown showing percentages of high, medium, and low probability content
- A CSV file with paragraph-by-paragraph analysis results

## Technical Details

The system uses a robust AI detection model based on the transformer architecture. The model analyzes linguistic patterns, coherence, and statistical properties of text to determine the likelihood it was generated by AI.

The application includes fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability even when the primary model cannot be loaded, making it resilient to deployment issues.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (optional, for accelerated processing)
- Telegram Bot Token
